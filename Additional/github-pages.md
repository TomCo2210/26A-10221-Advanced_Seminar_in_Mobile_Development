# GitHub Pages

## Introduction

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, using the repository name as `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username.
2. Create an `index.html` file in the repository, with the content you want to display on your website.
3. Go to the repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the `main` branch as the source.
4. Click on the URL provided in the GitHub Pages section to access your website.

To Create another page, follow these steps:

1. Create a new HTML file in the repository, with the content you want to display on the new page.
2. Go to the repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Click on the URL provided in the GitHub Pages section to access your website.
4. To access the new page, add the file name to the URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<filename>.html`).

You can create a GitHub Pages site for a project, organization, or user account. You can also use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.
You can create a GitHub Pages site for any public repository on GitHub - you pass the repository name as `<username>.github.io/<repository>`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username and `<repository>` is the repository name you want to use for the site.
You can use `Readme.md` files to create project pages, or you can use the `docs` folder to create a documentation site.
