# Postman API Testing

In this guide, we will go through the steps of setting up Postman for testing and debugging API services.

## Step 1: Download and Install Postman

1. Go to the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and download the Postman app.
2. Install the Postman app on your machine.
3. Launch the Postman app.

6. Click on `Send` to make the request.

## Step 3: Inspect the Response

1. View the response status code, headers, and body.
2. Inspect the response body for the data returned by the API.
3. Use the response data to debug and test the API service.

## Step 4: Save and Share Requests

1. Save the request for future use by clicking on `Save`.
2. Share the request with team members by clicking on `Share`.
3. Collaborate on requests and collections using Postman's collaboration features.
